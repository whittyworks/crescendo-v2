        <h2>Hi, I'm Bea.</h2>
        
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been asking: <em>Who am I?</em></p>

        <p>That question led me through years of searching, studying, striving—trying to piece together an answer from what the world told me I should be. But the answer I was looking for wasn't out there. It was written into me from the beginning, by the One who made me.</p>

        <p>My Holy Crescendo was born from that discovery: the realization that I am fearfully and wonderfully made—not because of anything I've achieved or perfected, but because of who God is and how He sees me.</p>

        <div class="wildflower-accent">🌸 🌼 🌻</div>

        <p>This course is the fruit of a lifelong journey of study and prayer that encompasses the entire holistic person—body, mind, and spirit. It's a course designed to help the <em>whole woman</em>, not just her spirituality or just her organization, but all of her, woven together as God intended.</p>

        <p>I created <strong>Crescendo: Fearfully & Wonderfully Made</strong> because so many of us have been taught to compartmentalize: work on your spirituality <em>here</em>, your body <em>there</em>, your mind somewhere else entirely. But God made us whole. And when we encounter Him, He meets the whole woman—body, mind, and spirit.</p>

        <h3>What I Believe</h3>

        <p>The goal of this journey is simple but profound: to come closer to God and learn to see how He made each of us beautiful, fearfully and wonderfully. To understand that our bodies are not obstacles to overcome but temples designed with intention. That our minds are not burdens to manage but gifts with beautiful intricacies. That our spirits carry wonderful variation in their gifts, each one unique and necessary.</p>

        <p>Every week of Crescendo explores a different theme—always grounded in Scripture, always centered on Christ, always inviting you deeper into the truth of who you are. We incorporate music (each week has a reflection song for lectio divina) and the diverse beauty of wildflowers as metaphors for how God creates each of us with intentional uniqueness.</p>

        <h3>Why I Created This</h3>

        <p>I wanted to create something that wasn't just another program or checklist. Something that would help women stop striving and start <em>beholding</em>. To see themselves through His eyes, not through the distorted lens of comparison, achievement, or worldly standards.</p>

        <p>This isn't about fixing yourself or becoming someone new. It's about seeing—really seeing—who you already are in His eyes.</p>

        <p>I'm honored to walk this journey with you.</p>
